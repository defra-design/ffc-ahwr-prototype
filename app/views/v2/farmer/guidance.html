    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can get funding for a vet or team chosen by a vet, 
      to visit your farm and carry out a health and welfare review if you keep:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>beef cattle</li>
      <li>dairy cattle</li>
      <li>sheep</li>
      <li>pigs</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can have one review every rolling 12 months for one type of livestock until the end of funding. 
      If you have more than one type of eligible livestock, you must choose the one that you would like reviewed.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">A health and welfare review will help you:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>reduce endemic diseases and conditions</li>
      <li>increase animal productivity</li>
      <li>improve animal welfare</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The review is optional. 
      It will not be an inspection or be used for compliance or monitoring.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can choose the vet that you want to do the review.</p>

    <!-- Main body -->
    <h2 id="whattodo" class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list">
        <li>1. Check you’re eligible to apply</li>
        <li>2. Apply for a review</li>
        <li>3. Set up a review</li>
        <li>4. Claim your funding</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="checkeligibility" class="govuk-heading-m">Check you’re eligible to apply</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must have a minimum number of animals on the date the vet visits your farm to do the review.
        You must have:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>11 or more beef cattle</li>
        <li>11 or more dairy cattle</li>
        <li>21 or more sheep</li>
        <li>51 or more pigs</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">The livestock must be registered in England and you must be responsible for their welfare.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You must be eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS). 
        To be eligible for BPS the farm or business must have at least:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>5 hectares (ha) of BPS eligible land</li>
        <li>5 BPS entitlements on 16 May 2022</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your farm or business must also have a Single Business Identifier (SBI).</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can apply for a review if you have also applied for lump sum payment to leave or retire from farming.
      </p>

    <h2 id="howmuch" class="govuk-heading-m">How much funding you’ll get</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get funding for each livestock type, not for each animal.
        You’ll get:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
        <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
        <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
        <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">The funding amount for each type of livestock is different because:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>testing may take longer for some types of livestock</li>
        <li>some results cost more to analyse</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        This funding will cover the endemic disease and condition testing costs. 
        It will contribute towards the costs for the vet’s time and your time.
      </p>

    <h2 id="whattoexpect" class="govuk-heading-m">What to expect from a review</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The review can take between 2 to 3 hours of your time and the vet’s time. 
        You can agree with the vet to spread it over several regular visits to the farm or do it all in one visit.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The vet should carry out endemic disease or condition testing of your livestock.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">They should also discuss one or more of the following with you as part of the review:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>health and welfare, including issues such as lameness, body conditioning or mobility scoring</li>
        <li>biosecurity, including internal and external biosecurity recommendations</li>
        <li>medicine usage, including antibiotics, vaccinations and how you can register and submit data on the
          <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/medicine-hub" target="_blank">Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Medicine Hub</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You do not need to cover all of these areas. 
        The review is flexible, so you can focus on the most important areas in the 2 to 3 hours the vet visits you.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should agree with the vet:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>when they’ll carry out the review</li>
        <li>what they’ll do</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">After the review the vet will provide you with a:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>written report, including recommended follow-up actions and the test results</li>
        <li>completed review record form</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="apply" class="govuk-heading-m">Apply for a review</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can 
        <a href="apply/start">apply for an annual health and welfare review</a> 
        of your livestock.
      </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once your application has been confirmed, contact your vet to arrange a review.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What you need to ask the vet to do</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Before the review ask your vet to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>read the
        <a href="../vet/guidance" target="_blank">guidance on how to carry out an annual health and welfare review of livestock</a>
      </li>
      <li>read the
        <a href="../vet/guidance/technical" target="_blank">technical guidance on how to carry out disease and endemic condition testing and approved laboratories</a>
        for the review
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#">download a review record form</a>
        to complete and give to you after the review
      </li>
      <li>confirm they’re able to do the review</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What to ask your vet to test for</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must ask your vet to test for:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in beef cattle</li>
        <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy cattle</li>
        <li>the effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep</li>
        <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS) in pigs</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can use these test results for other accreditation schemes you’re a member of. 
        You cannot use other accreditation scheme test results to apply for funding.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The vet will not test for other medical conditions or diseases as part of the review.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you’re already testing for these diseases or conditions, you can arrange a review so that it fits with your schedule. 
        For example, if you recently carried out testing, wait until the next time you need to do it to take advantage of the review.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To find out more about testing you can read the 
        <a href="../vet/guidance/technical">technical guidance on disease and endemic condition testing</a>.
      </p> 

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Farm visit</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The vet will visit the farm to discuss biosecurity, medicines, the health and welfare of your livestock and test results.
      </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Written report</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        After the vet has completed the review, they’ll give you a written report. 
        The report should explain:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>endemic disease or condition testing results</li>
        <li>
          other review findings - for example, biosecurity recommendations, medicine usage advice 
          or suggested species-specific health and welfare actions
        </li>
        <li>
          agreed achievable actions to address issues raised by the review or testing 
          - likely to be 2 to 3 but can be more or less based on individual needs
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must ask the vet for this report. 
        It will not be shared with Defra or used for site visits or other compliance checks.
      </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Review record form</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must ask the vet to give you a completed review record form. This is evidence the review took place. 
        The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) may ask to see it.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The review record form includes:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the date the vet carried out testing for endemic diseases or conditions</li>
        <li>the type of livestock reviewed</li>
        <li>how many animals were tested for endemic diseases or conditions - 
          the vet must test a minimum number of animals for you to receive funding</li>
        <li>vet’s name and Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) number</li>
        <li>unique reference number for laboratory test results</li>
        <li>confirmation the vet has given you a written report</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your vet should use the <a href="#">review record form</a> to gather this information.
      </p>


    <h2 id="claim" class="govuk-heading-m">Claim funding for a review</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        After the vet has completed the review and given you a written report 
        and completed review record form you can claim your funding. 
        You’ll be asked to share the following information:
      </p>
