    <p class="govuk-body">
      The aim of the annual health and welfare review is for a vet or team chosen by a vet, to help a farmer:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>reduce endemic diseases and conditions </li>
      <li>increase animal productivity</li>
      <li>improve animal welfare</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">The review is not an inspection or audit and it is optional.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      A farmer is eligible for an annual health and welfare review of livestock if they keep:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>11 or more beef cattle</li>
      <li>11 or more dairy cattle</li>
      <li>21 or more sheep</li>
      <li>51 or more pigs</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="arrangereview" class="govuk-heading-m">Arrange a review</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The farmer will contact you to arrange a review for the livestock type they’ve selected and give you a reference number. 
      You'll need this reference number to include in the record of the review you’ll give the farmer.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The review can take between 2 to 3 hours of your time and the farmer’s time. 
      You can spread the review over several regular visits to the farm or do it in a single visit.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should carry out endemic disease or condition testing of your livestock.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should discuss one or more of the following as part of the review:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>health and welfare</li>
      <li>biosecurity</li>
      <li>medicine usage</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You do not need to cover all of these topics. 
      The review is flexible, 
      so you can focus on the most important topics for the farm in the 2 to 3 hours you visit the farm.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You should agree with the farmer:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>when you’ll carry out the review</li>
      <li>what you’ll do</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">After the review you must give the farmer a:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>written report, including recommended follow-up actions and the test results</li>
      <li>completed review record form</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="endemic" class="govuk-heading-m">Testing for endemic disease and condition</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should carry out testing for the livestock type the farmer has selected for review. 
      You should test for one of the following: 
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in beef cattle</li>
      <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy cattle</li>
      <li>the effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep</li>
      <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You do not need to test for other medical conditions or diseases as part of the review.    
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should send the sample to a laboratory 
      recommended by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for review testing.  
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The farmer can use these test results for other accreditation schemes they’re a member of. 
      They cannot use other accreditation scheme test results to apply for the annual health and welfare review.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Read the 
      <a class="govuk-link" href="guidance/technical">technical guidance for endemic disease and condition testing and recommended laboratories</a>
       for the review.
    </p>

  <h2 id="advice" class="govuk-heading-m">Health and welfare advice</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Depending on the farm, you may choose to give advice on topics 
      such as lameness, body conditioning or mobility scoring.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Work with the farmer to improve the health and productivity of their animals. 
      Discuss some easy wins and some more ambitious targets
      to improve the health and welfare of their livestock. 
    </p>

  <h2 id="biosecurity" class="govuk-heading-m">Review biosecurity</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Depending on the farm, you may choose to review biosecurity measures.
      Discuss the benefits of good biosecurity and any recommendations for improving it.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For external biosecurity this may include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>purchasing policies</li>
      <li>farm visitors and vehicles</li>
      <li>wildlife</li>
      <li>interaction with other farm animals</li>
      <li>quarantine plans</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">For internal biosecurity this may include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>feed stores</li>
      <li>contaminated water</li>
      <li>sheds</li>
      <li>isolation of sick stock</li>
      <li>movement control</li>
      <li>training farm workers</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="medicine" class="govuk-heading-m">Review medicine usage</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Depending on the farm, you may choose to review farm medicines, 
      including how to prescribe and use them.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You could discuss:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>recommendations about medicines used on the farm, including antibiotics and vaccinations</li>
      <li>preventative medicines, including how and when they should be used as well as information on how to store them</li>
      <li>the value of testing over treating and why the right diagnostics can save money</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can tell the farmer about the 
      <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/medicine-hub" target="_blank">Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Medicine Hub</a>
      . Explain how it can help them and encourage them to register if they haven’t already.
    </p>

  <h2 id="report" class="govuk-heading-m">Written report</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You must give the farmer recommendations and actions in a written report.
      The report should explain:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>endemic disease or condition testing results</li>
      <li>other review findings - for example, biosecurity recommendations, medicine usage advice 
        or suggested species-specific health and welfare actions</li>
      <li>agreed achievable actions to address issues raised by the review or testing 
        - likely to be 2 to 3 but can be more or less based on individual needs</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can create a separate review report 
      or you can integrate the recommendations and actions into an existing health and welfare document.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Make sure you can identify the review recommendations and actions if you integrate it.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The farmer and vet will need to read over what was agreed each year to be able to monitor progress 
      when the next review is carried out.
    </p>

  <h2 id="record" class="govuk-heading-m">Review record form</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should give the farmer a completed review record form. 
      The farmer must keep this as evidence the review took place. 
      The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) may ask to see it.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The review record includes:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the date you carried out testing for endemic diseases or conditions</li>
      <li>the livestock species reviewed</li>
      <li>how many animals you tested for endemic diseases or conditions - you must test a minimum number of animals to receive funding</li>
      <li>unique reference number for laboratory test results</li>
      <li>confirmation you’ve given the farmer a written report</li>
      <li>your name and RCVS number</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should use the 
      <a href="#">review record form</a> 
      to gather this information.
    </p>

  <h2 id="afterreview" class="govuk-heading-m">After the review</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Invoice the farmer using your normal process.
      Your invoice must include the costs for:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>endemic disease and condition testing</li>
      <li>your time</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="funding" class="govuk-heading-m">Funding</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      A farmer will get funding for each livestock type, not for each animal. 
      They’ll get: 
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
      <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
      <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
      <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The funding amount for each livestock type is different because: 
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>testing may take longer for some livestock types</li>
      <li>some results cost more to analyse</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This funding will cover the endemic disease and condition testing costs 
      and will contribute towards the costs for:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the vet’s time</li>
      <li>the farmer’s time</li>
    </ul>
