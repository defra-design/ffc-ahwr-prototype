            <li>The Secretary of State for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Seacole Building, 2
              Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF, acting through the Rural Payments Agency, whose principal address is at

            Grant to the Agreement Holder in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below and in the Agreement
            Document.</p>

          <p>(B) The Authority is responsible for managing Countryside Stewardship, the scheme under which the Grant is
            paid. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has overall responsibility for the
            Countryside Stewardship scheme and may directly enforce any terms of the Agreement against the Agreement
            Holder in accordance with clause 28.2. Countryside Stewardship will be delivered in accordance with Chapter
            1, of Part 1 of The Agriculture Act 2020 c.21.</p>

          <p>(C) Grants made under Countryside Stewardship pay for Capital Items and/or Multi-Year Options (as defined
            below). Details of the individual Agreement Holder’s Capital Items and/ or Multi-Year Options are set out in
            the Agreement Document.</p>

          <p>(D) These terms and conditions apply to grant agreements made under the Countryside Stewardship scheme and
            should be read in conjunction with the details of the Grant set out in the Agreement Document, which are
            individual to the Agreement Holder. These terms and conditions and the Agreement Document (including the
            supporting documents specified therein) together form the agreement between the Authority and the Agreement
            Holder (“the Agreement”).</p>

          <p>(E) Additional Scheme requirements and more detailed information and guidance are set out in the
            Countryside Stewardship Manual and supplements available on www.gov.uk. The Agreement Holder must
            familiarise themselves with this document and ensure compliance with all mandatory elements of the relevant
            Countryside Stewardship Manual and supplements as a condition of receiving the Grant.</p>

          <p>(F) In the event of any conflict between these terms and conditions and the documents referred to in
            paragraphs (D) and (E) above, these terms and conditions shall prevail, followed by the Agreement Document,
            the supporting documents referred to in the Agreement Document, and then the Countryside Stewardship Manual.

            are available.</p>

          <p>8.3 Any failure by the Agreement Holder to submit a Payment Claim in accordance with the instructions and
            by the specified deadline (including the provision of any supporting documents necessary to enable the claim

          <p>8.4 If the Agreement Holder fails to submit a valid Payment Claim by the specified deadline, the Grant may
            be subject to a reduction. In the case of severe delays, the Payment Claim may be rejected in its entirety.
            Further details of when reductions may be applied and how they are calculated are set out in the Countryside

          <p>8.6 The Authority reserves the right to adjust the payment rate for Multi-Year Options where necessary to

            an actual or anticipated change to the Account Holder’s nominated business bank or building society account,
            the Authority may withhold payments until such time as the Authority is satisfied that the changes have been

          <p>16.5 The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not require either party to act as a

            the terms of this Agreement.</p>

          <p>16.8 The Agreement Holder acknowledges that Managing Authority and the Authority is subject to the

          <p>17.5 The Agreement Holder acknowledges and accepts that if it suffers any losses which prevent it from
            fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement, the Authority may require the Grant to be repaid or the

          <p>(a) the Agreement Holder has breached the terms of the Agreement or there is a change in circumstances

          <p>(b) the Agreement Holder has failed to repay any sum which has become recoverable by the Authority in
            accordance with clause 9.</p>

          <p>19.2 If the Authority terminates the Agreement under clause 19.1 above, it reserves the right to prohibit

            terminate the Agreement at the Break Point Date by giving not less than one month’s prior written notice to
            the other party. If notice is validly served under this clause, the Agreement will terminate on the Break
            Point Date, and subject to the Authority’s other rights and remedies under the Agreement, Grant payments
            already paid at the Break Point Date will not be recoverable.</p>

          <p>19.5 Where the Agreement includes the Multi-Year Option WD1 (Woodland Creation- Maintenance Payments), the

            option.</p>

          <p>19.6 The Agreement Holder may terminate the Agreement at any time by giving written notice to the
            Authority. The Agreement Holder understands that in such circumstances (albeit subject to clause 19.7 below)
            it may be required to repay all or part of the Grant and that its obligations under the Agreement shall not
            cease until such repayment has been made. Further details of when an Agreement Holder may be required to
            repay all or part of the Grant pursuant to termination under this clause 19.6 are set out in the Countryside
            Stewardship Manual.</p>

          <p>19.7 Where the Agreement Holder is successful in securing an agreement in another land management scheme
            that delivers equivalent or greater environmental value it may not be required to repay all or part of the
            Grant pursuant to clause 19.6. In this case the Agreement Holder will be able to terminate their agreement
            early without penalty usually at the end of the agreement year. This clause does not apply to the Capital
            Items that the Agreement Holder is required to carry out pursuant to their Agreement Document.</p>

          <p>19.8 If a third party acquires management control of any part of the Agreement Land and is not able or
            willing to take on the Agreement Holder’s obligations under the Agreement, the Authority may terminate the
