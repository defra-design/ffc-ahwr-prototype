  <!-- Intro -->
<p class="govuk-body">
  You can get funding for a vet or team chosen by a vet, to visit your farm and carry out a health and welfare review if you keep: 
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>beef cattle</li>
  <li>dairy cattle</li>
  <li>sheep</li>
  <li>pigs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">A health and welfare review will help you:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>reduce endemic diseases and conditions</li>
  <li>increase animal productivity</li>
  <li>improve animal welfare</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The review is not an inspection or audit and is optional.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can choose the vet that you want to do the review.</p>
  
  <!-- Main body -->
  <h2 id="howmuch" class="govuk-heading-m">How much funding you’ll get</h2>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get funding for each livestock type, not for each animal.</p>
     
  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
    <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
    <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
    <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">The funding amount for each type of livestock is different because:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>testing may take longer for some types of livestock</li>
    <li>some results cost more to analyse</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">The funding will cover the endemic disease or condition testing costs. It will also contribute towards the costs of both your time and the vet’s time.</p>

  <h2 id="whattoexpect" class="govuk-heading-m">What to expect from a review</h2>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">There’s no set amount of time for a review, but it’s likely to take between 2 and 3 hours of your time and the vet’s time. You may ask the vet to spread it over several regular visits to the farm or do it in a single visit.</p>
  
  <h2 id="mustinclude" class="govuk-heading-s">What a review must include</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">To receive funding, you must ask the vet to:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>visit your farm and test for the endemic disease or condition of the livestock type you’re having reviewed to recommended standards - bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy and beef cattle, effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs</li>
    <li>advise on the health and welfare of these livestock - including issues such as lameness, body conditioning or mobility scoring</li>
    <li>give you a written report after the review, including recommended follow-up actions and the relevant endemic disease or condition test results from the laboratory</li>
    <li>give you a summary of the review after they have completed it - you may be asked to provide this as evidence when you claim</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="caninclude" class="govuk-heading-s">What a review can include</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">You may also ask the vet to discuss one or both of the following:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>biosecurity, including internal and external biosecurity recommendations</li>
    <li>medicine usage, including antibiotics, vaccinations and how you can register and submit data on the
      <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/medicine-hub" target="_blank">Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Medicine Hub</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">
  You do not need to discuss both biosecurity and medicine usage. The review is flexible, focus on what is important for your farm when the vet visits you.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="checkeligibility" class="govuk-heading-m">Check you’re eligible to apply</h2>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You must have a minimum number of animals when the vet visits your farm to do the review.</p> 
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You must have one of the following:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>11 or more beef cattle</li>
    <li>11 or more dairy cattle</li>
    <li>21 or more sheep</li>
    <li>51 or more pigs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">The livestock must be registered in England and you must be responsible for their welfare when the vet carries out the review.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your business must have:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a single business identifier (SBI) linked to a county parish holding (CPH) number registered in England</li>
    <li>a CPH number that’s permanent or temporary</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You can only apply for a review on a CPH registered in England. You cannot apply for a review on CPHs registered in Wales or Scotland.</p>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">The CPH number cannot be:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>an 8000 number used for abattoirs, pet food manufacturers, racing pigeon establishments and showgrounds</li>
    <li>a 9000 number used for poultry keepers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">If you have received a lump sum payment to leave or retire from farming, you can still apply for a review.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">You can have a review of one eligible type of livestock every 10 months. If you have more than one eligible type, you must choose the one you would like reviewed.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">You cannot apply for another review of the same herd or flock until 10 months after you submitted your last application and accepted an agreement offer.</p>

  <h2 id="beforethereview" class="govuk-heading-m">Before the review</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">When you apply, you’ll be offered an agreement. You must accept your agreement offer and get an agreement number before you set up a review. Give this number to your vet when you contact them. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Agree with the vet when they’ll carry out the review and which optional topics they’ll focus on.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You must make sure the review is completed and you have claimed your funding within 6 months from the date you accept your agreement offer.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="askthevet">What you must ask the vet to do</h3>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">Before the review, ask the vet to read:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <a href="../vet/guidance.html" target="_blank">guidance on how to carry out an annual health and welfare review of livestock</a>

  </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="onthefarm">On the farm</h3>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You must ask the vet to visit the farm to carry out the required testing including:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in beef cattle</li>
    <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy cattle</li>
    <li>the effectiveness of worming treatments in sheep</li>
    <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You can:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>use these review test results for other accreditation schemes you’re a member of - you’ll need to check with the accreditation scheme that they will accept testing from the review</li>
    <li>schedule your review to fit in with your existing testing schedule if you’re already testing for these diseases or conditions to take advantage of the funding</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You cannot:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>use other accreditation scheme test results for this review funding</li>
    <li>ask the vet to test for other medical conditions or diseases as part of the review</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll only be eligible for funding if the vet:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>tests the minimum required number of animals for the type of review they’re doing</li>
    <li>carries out testing after your agreement date and before you claim</li>
    <li>get samples tested at a laboratory that meets the specifications for review testing</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">

  <h2 id="apply" class="govuk-heading-m">Apply for a review</h2>
    
  <p class="govuk-body">
    You can 
    <a href="/app/views/v3/farmer/apply/start.html"> apply for an annual health and welfare review of your livestock.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="after" class="govuk-heading-m">After the review</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">Before you can claim your funding, you must ask the vet to give you a written report and summary of the review.</p>

  <h2 id="written" class="govuk-heading-s">Get a written report</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">

    <li>other review findings - for example, biosecurity recommendations and medicine usage</li>
    <li>agreed achievable actions to address issues raised by the review or testing - likely to be 2 to 3 but can be more or less based on individual needs</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">The report can be either:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a specific report for the review</li>
    <li>included in an existing health and welfare document that covers the same timeframe as the agreement </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">Defra will not ask to see the report. It will also not be used for site visits or other compliance checks.</p>

  <h2 id="summary" class="govuk-heading-s">Get a summary of the review</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">You must ask the vet to provide the summary as a separate document. It can be a digital or paper version.</p>
